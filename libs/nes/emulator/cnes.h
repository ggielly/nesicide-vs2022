// The CNES class is the implementation of the NES as a complete
// emulatable machine.  It contains a RUN method which is used
// to drive the other objects (CPPU, C6502, CAPU, CROM) through
// the paces of emulating a NES as accurately as humanly possible.
//
// The CNES::RUN method drives each frame down through the PPU in
// the following order:
//
// Render visible scanlines, one at a time.
// Update scanline-dependent visual inspectors.
// Run the 'quiet' or resting scanline.
// Run the VBLANK scanlines.
// Run the 'pre-render' scanline.
//
// The NES object also is a container for globally useful stuff
// that is needed by the other objects.  Examples of this are:
// the current video mode; the current list of active breakpoints
// from the debugger; logic to perform breakpoint checks during
// emulation; the execution tracer database; and interfaces to
// provide a one-stop-shop for the debugger to retrieve disassembled
// code for a particular memory address.  The disassembled code
// interfaces are important otherwise each debugger inspector that
// needed to display disassembled code would need to replicate the
// logic to determine whether the address was in CPU RAM, or cartridge
// EXRAM, SRAM, or PRG-ROM.
//
// The NES object also contains information regarding the replay
// mode, which is used to record input sequences for testing.
