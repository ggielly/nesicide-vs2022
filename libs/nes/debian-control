Description: NES emulation core library used by NESICIDE. 
 This is the NES emulation core library that is used by the NESICIDE tools.
 It completely contains the elements of the NES system.  It provides APIs
 for loading a NES cartridge, resetting the emulation, and running the NES
 for a frame.  It also contains APIs useful for debugging the internal state
 of the NES at any point, including the ability to set breakpoints in any of
 the NES components.
