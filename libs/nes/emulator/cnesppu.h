// The CPPU class is the implementation of the PPU of the NES.
// It provides PPU-fetch-cycle granular emulation of the PPU core.
// It is implemented as a object so that accesses to its
// internal data via accessor functions does not require a class object.
//
// The class internally maintains the state of the PPU's registers
// and of the 2KB of RAM that is on the NES mainboard, dedicated to
// the PPU.  It also internally maintains the state of 32 bytes of
// palette memory and 256 bytes of Object Attribute Map (OAM) memory.
// The class also maintains several data structures used by debugger inspectors.
//
// The PPU object is currently driven by the NES object (see CNES).
// An entire PPU-frame's worth of execution is contained within one
// iteration of the CNES::RUN method.  This may change in the
// future so that the PPU runs itself and the CNES merely provides
// clock ticks.  But, for now, the current CNES::RUN is accurate
// enough.
//
// The current architecture of the emulation engine is:
//
// CNES->CPPU->C6502->CAPU
//
// where the NES object (CNES) uses PPU object APIs to drive
// sub-frame events (screen rendering, VBLANK, etc.) to the PPU (CPPU).
// The PPU object then executes enough PPU cycles to perform the
// requested action from the NES object (ie. render a scanline).
// During execution of PPU cycles the PPU filters cycles down to
// the CPU core (C6502) by using the current video-mode's filter
// (ie. either 3:1 for NTSC or 3.2:1 for PAL).  The CPU object
// executes instruction cycles when kicked by the PPU object.
// The CPU object also executes APU cycles by passing the execution
// over to the APU object (CAPU).
// There are some slight complications in this scheme such as
// PPU or APU DMA events, but those do not perturb the general
// flow described here too drastically.  The CPU/APU share the same
// cycle frequency (1,789,772.72Hz).  The APU 'frame', however, is
// not at all related to the PPU frame.  The CPU itself has no concept
// of 'frame'.
